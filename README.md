# Percipio Instant Search - Visual Studio Code Extension
This extension adds a quick command to search Percipio without leaving your favorite VS Code. You can find the command by name `percipio search` or by using the hotkeys `cmd+h` on Mac or `ctrl+h` on Windows, `h` stands for `help`. As an alternative you can execute search instantly from a context menu (select text -> right click -> Percipio Search) or by using the hotkeys `cmd+shift+h` on Mac or `ctrl+shift+h` on Windows.

## Features
